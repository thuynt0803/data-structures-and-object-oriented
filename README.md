Algorithm written by me in C ++
(I'm not sure it's perfect )

# Consists of:

## Programming basic

Basic commands:

    1. Branch control commands:

> - If ... Else
> - Switch structure

    2. Cycle control commands:

> - While structure
> - Do ... While structure
> - For structure
> - Break and Continue statement

    3. Arrays, String of characters, Pointers

> Custom by array, string and pointer
> I truly wonder what's the point behind this.

    4. Functions

> Custom by function
> I hope it's really helpful

    5. Structured data type

> - Struct array
> - Enum and Typedef data types
> - Struct pointer
> - File data type
